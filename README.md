#### **What is the business problem:** </br>
Predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetes patients. </br>
Avoid early discharge of patients to home in order to decrease the rate of readmission. </br>
#### **Download data from:** </br>
The public data used in the exercise will be downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/friedrichschneider/diabetic-dataset-for-readmission). This will require you to sign in to Kaggle. Find the descriptions of the variables [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission). </br>
#### **Machine learning steps:** </br>

#### **The technology used:** </br>
- [AI Platform on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform)
- [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs)
- [Looker](https://looker.com/)</br>

Follow [this notebook](Predict-hospital-readmission-with-BQML-and-AutoML.ipynb) to build your healthcare ML application on GCP using BigQuery and Python libraries for **data preparation and feature engineering** to enrich your data, BigQuery ML and AutoML for **model building and evaluating** the results and Looker for **visualisation**. </br>
The details for the visualisations in Looker are not covered in this repository. Please check the Looker website and the documentation [here](https://docs.looker.com/). </br>
