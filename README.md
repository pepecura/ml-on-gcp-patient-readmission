### Healthcare application of Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform </br>
### Predicting patient hospital readmission with BQML and AutoML </br>
#### **What is the business problem:** </br>
Predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetes patients. </br>
Avoid early discharge of patients to home in order to decrease the rate of readmission. </br>
#### **Download data from:** </br>
The public data used in the exercise will be downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/friedrichschneider/diabetic-dataset-for-readmission). This will require you to sign in to Kaggle. Find the descriptions of the variables [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission) </br>
#### **Machine learning steps:** </br>

#### **The technology used:** </br>
- [AI Platform on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform)
- [BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs)
- [Looker](https://looker.com/)</br>

Follow [the notebook](Predict-hospital-readmission-with-BQML-and-AutoML.ipynb) to start building your healthcare ML application on GCP using BigQuery and python packages for data preparation, BigQuery ML and AutoML for model building and Looker for visualisation. </br>
The details for the report building in Looker is not covered in this repository. Please check the Looker website and the documentation [here](https://docs.looker.com/) </br>
