### Healthcare application of Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform </br>
### Predicting patient hospital readmission with BQML and AutoML </br>
**What is the business problem** </br>
Predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetes patients. </br>
Avoid early discharge of patients to home in order to decrease the rate of readmission. </br>
**What data is used** </br>
The public data used in the exercise will be downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/friedrichschneider/diabetic-dataset-for-readmission). This will require you to sign in to Kaggle.  </br>
