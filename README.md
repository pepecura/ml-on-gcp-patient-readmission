**What is the business problem**
Predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetes patients.
Avoid early discharge of patients to home in order to decrease the rate of readmission.
**What data is used**
The public data used in the exercise will be downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/friedrichschneider/diabetic-dataset-for-readmission). This will require you to sign in to Kaggle.
